# cardsWithOOD
## Note
One thing I need to first note the reason why it is in a folder is because codespaces was viewing my code as a "non-project file" So I used gemini to help solve that error because it refused to run my files and I struggled to figure it out on my own.

## Files
CardGame.java contains the game functions and is the sample code provided

Card.java is what I wrote and builds out how the structure for cards

cards.txt is the provided deck of cards

## Description

This project is a simple card game and I added a few new features to make the game more intreseting


## New Features
Added: Ascii visualizer for the cards in terminal on run to display user hand
