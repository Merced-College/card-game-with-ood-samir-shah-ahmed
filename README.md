## Note
One thing I need to first note the reason why it is in a folder is because codespaces was viewing my code as a "non-project file" So I used gemini to help solve that error because it refused to run my files and I struggled to figure it out on my own.

## Files
CardGame.java contains the game functions and is the sample code provided

Card.java is what I wrote and builds out how the structure for cards

cards.txt is the provided deck of cards

## Description

This project is a simple card game and I added a few new features to make the game more interesting and complex(I had fun thinking about and making this). I have never used copilot before and its really cool to see how well it can debug and help with writing code along with guiding me in the right direction for writing code thanks for higlighting it in the video!.


## New Features
Added: Ascii visualizer for the cards in terminal on run to display user hand

Added: Player 2 

Added: Competition feature, the 2 players compete when one of the players has a pair they win, if neither or both have a pair they 
compete for the highest value card. If they are both matched evenly (I had to adjust the probability of this happening since it occured
way too often on the first try) then the game ties. 

Added: fun fact generator
